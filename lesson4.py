# Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related 
# to the rest of the program

# This is a logical error. The syntax is valid Python code, but the code does 
# not produce the desired result because a problem occurs in its logic

# The colon at the end of a for statement tells Python to interpret the next

# To use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as 
# squares. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for 
# the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is 
# value**2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop 
# to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the 
# square brackets.

# It doesnâ€™t often make sense to build a tuple with one element, but this can happen 
# when tuples are generated automatically.

# I'm not sure completely agree with this statement, based on my experience with other languages
# Perhpas there is a more Python way to do things, but I can think of perhaps one use case
# This is a case well beyond our introduction to Python, but If i were to mode a type Option
# that models the presence or non presence of an item, I might use an empty tuple to model the none presence
# and a tuple with one element to model the presence of an item.  Again this is advanced use case
# there may be some more appropriate way in Python I'm not aware of yet.
